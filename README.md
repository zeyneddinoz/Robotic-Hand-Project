# Robotic-Hand-Project

This was a school project which made with his classmates while he was studying his bachelor's degree in the Dept. of Computer Engineering in 2017. It earned 2nd place in Inonu University's Robotic Tournament named Robocot. 


Required Hardware:

* 1x Arduino UNO R3
* 2x NRF24L01+
* 2x NRF24L01+ Adapter 
* 5x Flex Sensor (We made our own flex sensor using Velostat. Do not forget that it has an uncertain lifetime)
* 5x MG90S Servo
* 5x Steel Springs
* 1x Gloves
* 3 in 1 Jumper Wire
* Breadboard
* Foam Board
* Nylon Strings
* Glue Gun
* Cable Ties
* Arduino Compatible SCM & DIY Kits


Please note that due to differences in sensor affects, you may need to fine-tune to parameters.


Remember that this is not completely new, you can find better examples. 
There is already a standard code for this problem.

Thank you for your concentration.

Greetings to all droid doctors around the world! :)
